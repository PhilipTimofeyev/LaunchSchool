Informal
----------
Given an array of integers named integers

Create a new array called every_other

Iterator through integers one by one
	- push the starting value to every_other
	- check if the index value is even
	- if even, push to every_other
	- elsif odd, do not push

After iterating through the collection, return every_other

START

# Given a collection of integers called "integers"

SET every_other = every other integer in array "integer"
SET iterator = 1

While iterator <= length of numbers
	SET current_number - value within the integers collection at space "iterator"
	If current_value[index].odd? == true
		push current_value to every_other
	else
		ignore current_number
	
	iterator += 1

PRINT every_other
