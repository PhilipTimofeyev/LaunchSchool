**Important Language**

On `line #` we are initializing the local variable `###` and assigning it to an #integer with value `###`.

Each element is passed to the block in turn and assigned to the local variable `###`. 

On `line #` we are reassigning variable `###` to a different #string object that has a value of `###`.

On `lines #â€“#` we are defining the method `###` which takes parameter, `###`.

On `line #` we are calling the method `###` and passing in the #string `###` as an argument to it.

On `line #` we are calling the method `#loop` and passing in the `do..end` block as an argument with parameter, `###`.

On `line #` we are calling the method `#puts` and passing in local variable `###` to it as an argument.

This code outputs #string `###`  and returns #array  `###`.

'We call the method on the object `var` points to'





Concepts:

Variables as pointers

Variable Scope

Mutation

Reassignment

Mutability

Pass by value

Pass by reference

Truthiness

Precidence - blocks have the lowest precedence of all operators. But between the two, `{ }` has slightly higher precedence than `do...end`.

Variable Shadowing

Indexed Assignment

Transformation?

Selection?

Iteration?
