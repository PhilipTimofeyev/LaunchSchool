### Attributes and Instance Variables

*Classes don't define instance variables, they define attributes. Instance variables do not exist prior to an object being created and a valu ebeing assigned to them.*

When we speak of `@name`, we speak of it as an instance variable within the context of its belonging to a particular object, and we can spear of it as an *attritube signifier* within the context of class definition.

*All initialized instance variables reference `nil`*.
