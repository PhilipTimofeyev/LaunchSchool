**Important Language**

On `line #` we are initializing the local variable `###` and assigning it to an #integer with value `###`.

On `line #` we are reassigning variable `###` to a different #string object that has a value of `###`.

On `lines #â€“#` we are defining the method `###` which takes parameter, `###`.

On `line #` we are calling the method `###` and passing in the #string `###` as an argument to it.

On `line #` we are calling the method `#loop` and passing in the `do..end` block as an argument with parameter, `###`.

On `line #` we are calling the method `#puts` and passing in local variable `###` to it as an argument.

This code outputs #string `###`  and returns #array  `###`.





**Local Variable Scope**

1. ```ruby
   a = "Hello"
   b = a
   a = "Goodbye"
   puts a
   puts b
   ```

   > On `line 1` we are initializing the local variable `a` and assigning it to a string with value `Hello`. On `line 2` we are initializing the local variable `b` to a string object that variable `a` is referencing, so both of the variables are pointing to the same object. 
   >
   > On `line 3` we are reassigning variable `a` to a different string object that has a value of `Goodbye`.  So now variable `a` is pointing to a string object with a value of `Goodbye` and variable `b` is pointing to a string object with a value of `Hello`.
   >
   > On `line 4` we are calling the method `puts` and passing in local variable `a` to it as an argument, which outputs `'Goodbye'` and returns `nil`. 
   >
   > On `line 5` we are calling the method `puts` and passing in local variable `b` to it as an argument, which outputs `'Hello'` and returns `nil`.
   >
   > This demonstrates the concept of reassignment, specifically that a variables point to objects, so once a variable is reassigned it points to a different object without affecting the original object.
   
2. ```ruby
   a = 4
   
   loop do
     a = 5
     b = 3
     
     break
   end
   
   puts a
   puts b
   ```

   > The local variable `a` is initialized on line 1 and assigned to the integer `4`. The `do..end` alongside the loop method invocation on lines 3 to 6 defines a block, within which `a` is assigned to integer `5` and local variable  `b` is initalized and assigned to integer `3`. The puts method is called on variable `a` and outputs  `4`  and returns `nil`. The puts method is called on variable `b` and returns a NameError. This demonstrates the concept of variable scope in Ruby, specifically that variables initialized inside of a block are not accessible outside that block.

3. ```ruby
   a = 4
   b = 2
   
   loop do
     c = 3
     a = c
     break
   end
   
   puts a
   puts b
   ```

   > On `line 1` we initialize the local variable `a` to integer `4`. 
   >
   > On `line 2` we initialize the local variable `b` to integer `2`. 
   >
   > On `lines 4-8` we invoke the `loop` method and pass in a `do..end` block as an argument. Within the block we initialize the local variable `c` to the integer `3`. Variable `c` is scoped at the level of the block. Then on `line 6` we reassign variable `a` to the value of `c`, so now both `c` and `a` point to the same object. On `line 7` we use `break` to end the loop which returns `nil`. 
   >
   > The output of `line 10` is `3` and it returns `nil`.
   >
   > The output of `line 11` is `2` and returns `nil`. 
   >
   > This is an example of variable as pointers in Ruby, specifically that variables point to a memory in space, so assigning another variable to that variable points it to the same memory in space but it does not adopt the scope of the original variable.	
   
4. ```ruby
   def example(str)
     i = 3
     loop do
       puts str
       i -= 1
       break if i == 0
     end
   end
   
   example('hello')
   ```

   > On `lines 1-8` we define the method `example` which has one parameter, `str`. 
   >
   > On `line 10` we invoke the `example` method and pass in the string `hello` as an argument and assign it ot the local variable `str`, where `str` points to the `'hello'`. Inside the methid on `line 2` we initialize the variable `i` to integer `3`. Then on `lines 3-7` we invoke the `loop` method alongside the `do..end` block. On `line 4` we invoke the `puts` method and pass in the string `'hello` as an argument. On `line 5` we reassign the variable `i` to `i-.(1)` which sutracts integer `1` from `3` on each iteration until the variable `i` is reassigned to integer `0`. Since the iteration happens three times, it outputs `'hello` three times. Because the `break if` statement is the last evaluated expression, the method returns `nil`.

5. ```ruby
   def greetings(str)
     puts str
     puts "Goodbye"
   end
   
   word = "Hello"
   
   greetings(word)
   ```

   > On `lines 1-4` the method `greetings` is defined with one parameter, `str`. On `lin 6` the local variable `word` is initiated and assigned to a string with a value of `Hello`. On `line 8` we are invoking the method `greetings` and passing in the variable `word`. 
   >
   > Once passed in, the local variable `str` is assigned to the argument passed in, the variable `word`. So now both `str` and `word` point to the same object, `"Hello`". On `line 2` the `puts` method is called and passes the `str` variable in as an argument, which outputs `"Hello"` and returns `nil`. Then on `line 3` the `puts` method is called and passes in the string `Goodbye` which outputs `"Goodbye"` and returns `nil`.

     counter += 1
     break if counter == arr.size
   end
   
   puts "Your total is #{sum}"
   ```

   > On `line 1` we initialized the variable `arr` and assign it to an array with four integers as elements, `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. On `line 3` we initialize the variable `counter` and assign it to an integer with a value of `0`. On `line 4` we initialize the variable `sum` and assign it to an integer with a value of `0`. 
   >
   > On `lines 6-10`, we invoke the `loop` method and pass in a `do..end` block as an argument. Within the block on `line 7`, we reassign the `sum` variable to `sum + arr[counter]` using the `Integer+` method and passing in `arr[counter]` as an argument. On `line 8` we reassign the `counter` variable to `counter.+ (1)` using the `Integer+` method and passing in the `counter` variable as an argument. On `line 9` we stop the loop if the conditional `counter == arr.size` returns `true`.  With each iteration of the loop, each element of the `arr` variable is being access and added to the total `sum`. until the value of the `counter` is equal to the value of `arr.size`.
   >
   > On `line 12` the `puts` method is called and passes in the string `Your total is #{sum}` which uses string interpolation to convert the integer value of `sum` to a string. This outputs `"Your total is 10"` and returns `nil`.

   >
   > One `lines 4-7`, we call the `times` method on the integer `2` and pass in a `do..end` block with a parameter of `a`. Because the parameter for the block has the same name as the variable `a` in the main scope, variable shadowing occurs and prevents the block from being able to access the main scope variable `a`. This is why instead of reassigning variable `a` to the integer with a value of `5`, it initializes a new variable `a` and assigns it to an integer with a value of `5`. At this point, there are two variable `a`s and they point to seperate objects.
   >
   > On `line 6`, the `puts` method is called and passes the variable `a` of the block into it, because we are within the scope of the block, and outputs `5` two times. The block returns the `2` because the times method returns the initial integer.
